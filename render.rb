# This script grabs the latest release details from the GitHub API for a project
# and then generates a Homebrew Formula.
#
# It currently assumes you have separate binaries for Linux and macOS and generates
# a forumula which works with both homebrew and linuxbrew.
#
# This is intended for cases where projects release quickly and you want a Homebrew Tap
# to track those releases closely, and where you don't have automation (like
# Goreleaser) which can generate Homebrew Formula automatically.
